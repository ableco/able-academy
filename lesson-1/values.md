# Able Core values

At Able our goal is to be the best place to build products. Engineering and product development are critical processes that we continue to hone and develop. Everything we do at Able should align with the Core Values of the company:

### 1. Stability    ###

Greater stability for product builders creates a more effective place to build product.

### 2. Productivity ###

A more productive environment increases the number of opportunities  we can pursue, while lowering the opportunity cost .

### 3. Opportunity  ###

We value opportunities that allow us to pursue early-stage impact, equity, and profit sharing.

# Able Engineering Values

Able holds a parallel set of Engineering Values that allow us to deliver Stability, Productivity, and Opportunity through our product development process:

### 1. Clarity           ###
### 2. Consistency       ###
### 3. Conscientiousness ###

# 1. Clarity

* Clear, easy-to-understand communication is the most important engineering value
* Applies to everything we deliver: code, Github issues, design feedback, acceptance tests, daily standup updates, Slack messages, and more.
* Allows us to collaborate better, to move faster and more efficiently
* Communication overhead is the biggest scaling bottleneck as a team grows in size and scope


# 2. Consistency

* Consistent processes let us deliver high quality, reliable products in an efficient manner.
* Consistent code is predictable code. Keeping with established conventions makes code easier to read and reduces the chances of surprise complexity.
* Consistent processes are more efficient by nature and keep the team on the same page with regard to expectations.
* Consistency across projects reduces onboarding time for new contributors. More knowledge and experience can also carry over from one project to another.

# 3. Conscientiousness

* Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being thorough, careful, or vigilant. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well.
* Conscientious coding is the understanding that code is written once but read hundreds of times. It prioritizes readability and ease of understanding over cleverness, shortcuts, and speed.
* Conscientious product development is acknowledging that a product’s impact is far-reaching: on colleagues, stakeholders, and the company’s ability to engage and retain partners.
* Conscientious collaboration is knowing that everyone on the team has a job to do, and being considerate of their responsibilities and differences.
