# Code clarity

Clearly written code enhances readability and reduces confusion, which leads to more reliable code, and thus a higher quality product.

* Code is written once, read dozens (or hundreds) of times; taking longer to write code that is easier to read is always worth it.
* Readable code means less time reading, more time coding.
* Engineers are less likely to introduce bugs when they fully understand the code they are working with. Bugs are easier to fix when the problem can be diagnosed quickly.

## Two forms of code clarity

There are two ways code can be clear in its purpose, and while both sound like they describe the same thing, there is a distinct difference: 

### Code that is clear, readable, and easily understood


1. Clean, uncluttered code blocks
2. Descriptive variable and method names
3. “Self-documenting” code

### Code that is not vague, ambiguous, or confusing

1. Code that doesn’t seem to serve a purpose, or does not make it obvious what its purpose is
2. Inconsistent code that doesn’t follow a pattern or established convention
3. Illogical code paths, code that makes you ask “why is it doing this?”

Code that is highly descriptive and self-documenting is "actively" clear in its meaning, code that is _not_ vague, ambiguous, or confusing is "passively" clear. While some code will be complex by nature and cannot achieve active clarity, **all code should strive for passive clarity.**
