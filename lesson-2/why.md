# The importance of clarity

Clear, effective communication is perhaps the most important skill for an engineering technical lead.

As a highly collaborative, cross-functional team working on multiple projects at once, it is important to establish mutual understanding in everything we do.

Whether we are writing code, Github issues, design feedback, or acceptance tests, one or more people will be relying on that information to do their jobs. This is especially important when it comes to our code because it plays a critical role in the company as the foundation of every product we deliver.
