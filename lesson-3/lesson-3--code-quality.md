# Code Quality
Able Academy Lesson 3

## Code Quality Principles

#### 1. Organization: How components integrate with each other
#### 2. Readability: How individual components are built
#### 3. Extensibility: Safeguards for development that maintain organization and readability

### Organization

Well-organized code maintains a predictable structure that is self-reinforcing over time. Examples include:

* Coherent naming conventions that help to inform how to name new objects.
* An intuitive directory structure that makes it obvious what code belongs where.
* Well-defined responsibilities for each section of the codebase. Redux action, reducers, and state are a good example of code that is not vague or ambiguous in its purpose.

The most direct way code organization can be self-reinforcing is by limiting ambiguity and edge cases. Well-organized code strives to be consistent and predictable. Over time, edge cases introduce breaks in consistency that eventually undermine the code's predictability.
